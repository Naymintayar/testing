	<h3>Line Break Tag</h3>
	<center>
	<p>
		Whenever you use the &lt br / &gt element, anythingfollowing it starts from the next line. This tag is an example of an empty element, where you don not need opening and closing tags, as there is nothing to go in between them. <br />
		The &lt br / &gt tag has a space between the characters br and the forward slash. If you omit this space, older browsers will have trouble rendering the line break, while if you miss the forward slash character and just use &lt br  &gt it is not valid in XHTML.<hr />
